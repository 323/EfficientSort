EfficientSort was based off of the BogoSort sorting program.

EfficientSort strives to be one of the slowest and least effective ways to sort data, ever.

At the moment, with the current array (the numbers 0-10), EfficientSort is estimated to have a 1/(10^10) chance of getting all of the numbers correct.

As you may have guessed, the program's name (EfficientSort) is meant to be sarcastic.

Anyway, right now there's support for the first and soon to be second numbers, and I'm hoping to have support for all 10 numbers before long.

I also need to find a way to make the code look nicer and run in less lines, right now it's written horribly.

Enjoy! Any questions? Feel free to email me - starcraft47 at gmail.com
